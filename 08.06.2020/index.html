        A Couple of months ago I watched
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D1J0v82Dgnk">this</a> video by
        Web Dev Simplified, where he was suggesting quarantine projects. The one
        that caught my eye was, as you probably know from the title; a CSS
        framework. I wanted to talk to you about how I went about building my
        CSS component library. I know what you're thinking, but it's an
        opportunity to make yourself stand out as a developer (more on that
        later).
      </p>
      <p>
        After the evening of watching the video, my mind was buzzing with ideas:
        buttons, colours, SCSS, documentation, the whole nine yards. The day
        after I asked as few developer friends what the name should be.
        Collectively we came up with
        <a href="https://rich-ui.netlify.app">Rich UI </a>.
      </p>
      <h2>Starting the plan</h2>
      <p>
        I later got to work designing the documentation. Later I used GitHub's
        project Trello board to organise everything I needed to get done. I
        marked out the Logo and all the components I needed. I wanted to collect
        all the components I always use across all my projects. This allows you
        to focus on the important parts rather than the repetitive ones. For
        example, let's say you are building something huge like an e-commerce
        site; just imagine how much time you will save by having premade all the
        components that you love.
      </p>

      <p>
        I soon realised the scale of this undertaking; I needed some way to make
        it downloadable I needed all sorts of buttons, cards and easily
        understood class names. I started by building the basic template for the
        full site and then added the components as I made them. While doing all
        this I was looking at many different CSS frameworks to see what they all
        had in common, this was simple things such as component types, download
        links a features section... I looked at lots of different frameworks for
        inspiration to list a few:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">BootStrap</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://materializecss.com/">Materialize</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://semantic-ui.com/">Semantic UI</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://bulma.io/">Bulma</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://purecss.io">PureCSS</a></li>
        <li><a href="http://getskeleton.com/">Skeleton CSS</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://milligram.io/">Milligram</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://get.foundation/">Foundation</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://getuikit.com/">UI Kit</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://uimini.vedees.ru/">UI Mini</a></li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        My personal favourite was UI Mini because of its simplicity and
        aesthetic style. Almost every CSS Framework/ component library had a
        landing page containing a 'Download' and a 'Get Started' call to action.
        The 'Get Started' would take you to the Docs and the Download would tell
        you how to download it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, a lot of them had some sort of card section that lists the
        benefits of their framework. They all have the all too familiar
        documentation section, with a fancy sidebar. Each had a section listing
        'big' sites that have used their framework and a series of changes they
        have made over the years. Just think for a second all these frameworks
        that hundreds rely on all mildly based of off each other. How can you
        stand out? How can you make something that isn't bootstrap that isn't a
        WordPress theme? Don't get me wrong I sometimes use BootStrap myself,
        but even little things make you stand out when it comes to UX; that
        little hover animation that took you four hours, it was worth it.
      </p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        If you want to build your very own framework or component library, I
        recommend taking it slowly. Plan out every single component you want
        even draw them if you need. Think of a name, do you want a documentation
        site? Think of a design. Make a list of everything you need: banner,
        logo, colour scheme, buttons... This list may be very long but I promise
        you once you take it slowly, taking the time to enjoy the process it
        will feel amazing to start ticking everything off.
