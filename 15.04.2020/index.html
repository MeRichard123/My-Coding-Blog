        Dear Developer, Today I decided to talk to you about one of
        <b>the best</b>
        code editors out there. Truly efficient Development always starts with
        the code editor. Of course you can probably develop a full CRUD app in
        notepad, but it's much easier when you have the correct tools for doing
        so. Having tools that are well equipt just makes the whole experience,
        as enjoyable as development should be - minus the errors and stress
        around that.
      </p>
      <h2>VS Code</h2>
      <p>
        The code editor I use is called
        <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a> . It is
        an editor made by Microsoft; it contains built-in debugging tools, Git
        and a built-in Terminal! VS Code also has hundreds of themes to choose
        from. The one I use is called
        <b>"Community Material Theme High Contrast"</b>. This gives you a
        beautiful dark mode editor with enough contrast between the terminal and
        the screen. They also have Icon packs for the files; again I think
        <b>"Material Icon Theme"</b> is an awesome option. Visual Studio Code
        also allows you to install extensions; which help with development
        efficiency. Here are some of the extensions I use on a day to day basis
        in web development.
      </p>
      <img src="./vscode.png" alt="" class="image" />
      <ol>
        <li>
          <b>Live Server -</b> One of the most amazing extensions you can have
          when building websites with just HTML, CSS and JS. It allows you to
          open the HTML file you are working on, and open it live in a browser.
          This allows you to view changes live!!! JS Frameworks such as React
          don't need this as you can use the <code>npm start</code> from
          create-react-app.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Live Sass Compiler -</b> I have never used any sort of compiled
          language before, I've also been lucky enough to have an IDE with shows
          errors at run time, however, when styling a web page I tend to use
          Sass as it has many useful functions; this is where the Sass compiler
          comes in handy, as websites can't run Sass code this extension
          converts your SCSS into CSS upon saving.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Prettier -</b> Prettier is another "edit on save" extension however
          this one help keep your code neat, removing extra whitespace, checking
          your brackets etc..
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Better Comments -</b> The better comments extension allows you to
          create coloured comments for things like todo lists, errors to draw
          attention and questions.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Bracket Pair Colorizer -</b> The bracket colouriser, pairs the
          correct brackets, allowing for much more efficient debugging.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Auto Rename Tag - </b> The auto rename tag allows you to rename the
          opening and closing HTML tag at the same time.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>CSS Peek -</b> Is an extension which allows you to see the CSS
          styling of Elements by inspecting them from the HTML file.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>EMMET -</b> VScode by default comes with this. Emmet speeds up
          development by miles; it can autocomplete code and create large chunks
          of markup from a little bit of code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>ES7 React/ Redux/ GraphQL/ React Native snippets -</b> I've only
          recently got into React JS, however, this snippet library, speeds up
          the boring code and lets you focus on the rest.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This is why VS Code is one of the best code editors for web development.
        Projects would take me absolutely ages without Emmet and the other
        extensions. Not only extensions, but it also has lots of keyboard
        shortcuts to make your life as a dev much easier.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Holding <kbd>Shift + alt + down arrow</kbd> allows you to quickly copy
          lines of code.
        </li>
        <li>
          Holding <kbd>Alt</kbd> while clicking parts of code, allows you to
          type in multiple places at once.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Along with Web Development I use VS Code for Python programming - unless
        I'm using the default IDLE which comes with python ðŸ˜‚. For Python
        development in VS Code, they have the python extension - This just show
        that the VS Code Devs had Web Development in mind. Useful python
        extensions include:
        <b>AREPL</b> which is almost like a silent debugging tool and
        <b>Python-autopep8</b> which like Prettier needs the "format on save
        setting" enabled. It formats your python code to abide by the
        <a href="https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/">PEP-8</a> code
        standards for Python.
      </p>
      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The Devs over at Microsoft have spent a lot of time perfecting their
        code editor, to make it as useful to developers worldwide. Not only that
        but they also allow you to type <code>code .</code> into a command
        prompt within a directory to automatically open a VS Code window.
