      <hr />
      <p>
        Ever since I first joined a discord server, I was intrigued by how a bot
        works. I joined a programming community and one of the bots, was the
        MEE6 bot, it was counting messages and giving people a level and a
        coloured name. I craved to know how such a thing is possible.
      </p>
      <h2>What is a Bot</h2>
      <p>
        By definition, a Bot is a programmable standalone piece of software.
        Which performs various tasks. A Discord Bot is a chatbot, which uses
        <b>Discord JS</b> to manage a server and make it more interactive for
        the user.
      </p>
      <h2>Discord JS</h2>
      <p>
        After researching further and further, I found that quite a few Discord
        Bots use Node JS. I went with that, as I've been trying to learn
        Javascript for quite a while. (Rather than Python which was also an
        option). I watched
        <a
          href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_qg0Ut9nU8&t=900s"
          target="_blank"
          >CodeLyon's</a
        >
        Discord JS series and made a simple action response bot with "ping" and
        "pong". From there, I extended the program to create simple embeds,
        assign roles and spam the chat. You will find all the functions you need
        and how to use them in the Discord JS documentation. With some basic
        knowledge of Javascript, you can too.
      </p>
      <h2>Making your very own bot (Quick run down)</h2>
      <p>
        Before starting, go to
        <a
          href=" https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/"
          target="_blank"
          >Discord Developers</a
        >
        create a new application. After that navigate to the "bot" tab, and hit
        "Add bot". <br /><br />
        Go back to general info and copy the client ID and paste it in the
        correct place
        <a href="https://discordapi.com/permissions.html" target="_blank"
          >here</a
        >. Select the permissions and click the link at the bottom to add it to
        a server. Now you have created the bot you can begin the fun part.<br /><br />
        Once you have the basics of a text editor and NodeJS, you are ready to
        go. First, create a folder with the name of your Bot and using the
        command line navigate into the folder.
        <br /><br />
        Run the following:<br />
        <code> npm init</code> <br />
        follow the prompts and give your app a name author and version.
        <br /><code>npm i discord.js --save </code>
      </p>
      <p>
        If none of that made sense, visit
        <a
          href=" https://github.com/AnIdiotsGuide/discordjs-bot-guide/blob/master/getting-started/getting-started-long-version.md"
          target="_blank"
          >This Repository</a
        >
        for a more in-depth explanation. Now you can open the files in VS code
        with the <code>code .</code> command (or your prefered editor.) The
        token comes from the bots tab in
        <a href="https://discordapp.com/developers/applications" target="_blank"
          >Discord Apps</a
        >. You will need to click this button: <kbd>Click to Reveal Token</kbd>.
        You will also need an index.js file in the directory.
      </p>
      <img src="./start.png" class="image" alt="" />
      <p>
        From the console you can run <code>node .</code> and the bot will run.
        After you check the server the bot should be online and will reply when
        you type "ping". For more commands check out my Repository for my first
        bot or the
        <a
          href="https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/stable/general/welcome"
          target="_blank"
          >Docs</a
        >.
      </p>
      <h2>Making the bot pretty</h2>
      <p>
        Making Code "pretty" is of course very subjective, but I think if you
        can navigate the code with ease after a week or two then you can class
        it as pretty. I am guilty of having millions of IF statements and having
        incredibly messy code when making bots. The best thing to do is to
        separate your code to make it more readable. I recommend either using
        functions to separate code or creating separator comments a little like
        this:
        <br />
        <br />
        <img src="./pretty code .png" alt="" class="image" />
      </p>
      <p>
        <br />
        As for Hosting; you can either run <code>node .</code> each time you
        want to use the bot. For a while I used something called "pm2" each time
        I wanted to run a bot, I had to run <code>pm2 start .</code>.Then I
        could close the terminal without bot turning off, However that required
        my computer to be on and that becomes quite tedious.
