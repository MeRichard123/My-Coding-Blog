        My first real programming experience was when I was in my first year in
        Secondary school. We started
        <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/" target="_blank">Scratch</a>
        programming. Those of you that don’t know it’s a drag and drop GUI with
        blocks generally used for 2D games.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was playing around with scratch for two years in school. Naturally, I
        wanted to know what scratch was capable of, push it to its limits and
        found many amazing projects the scratch community was working on. Very
        soon after taking apart many scratch projects and watching many YouTube
        videos, I got that feeling all programmers get: 'you feel as though you
        can do anything' until you come across a difficult concept, you start
        looking into it, and then it hits you. You realise you haven't even
        scratched the surface of what's possible. This is where my programming
        journey began; I started enjoying solving problems and making
        algorithms.
      </p>
      <h2>Python</h2>
      <p>
        About two years later I was in my first 'ICT' lesson; we began covering
        python. Being that age, I was instantly impressed by 'print' statements
        and 'inputs'. I went through a lot of practice in lessons, constantly
        solving problems and making little 'so called chat apps'. I watched many
        videos of people doing amazing things with python and wanted to be able
        to that them myslef in the future. Over this year I solved many
        algorithm problems and tried to get to grips with syntax along with how
        the language worked. Right at the end of the year was my first
        introduction to Web Development. I learned about the features of a site
        and finally how to build a basic one with Dreamweaver; as usual, the
        intrigued mind of mine clicked over to the code tab. Overwhelmed and
        confused I quickly switched back to the dragging and dropping elements
        into tables (yes at that time we still used HTML tables to organise
        content). I made an information website about types of Turtles and
        Tortoises (if you're intrested you can find an improved version I made 
        in 2019 on my portfolio linked in
        the <a href="#footer">footer</a>)
      </p>
      <h2>First Steps in HTML</h2>
      <p>
        Now a year later my GCSEs commenced. With programming being a key part
        of my computer science course, I had to learn more than the basics of Python I had
        to learn the flow of the language. My teacher introduced me to
        <a href="https://www.sololearn.com/">SoloLearn</a> (a great website to
        learn the basics of a language). After completing the course and
        creating many practice algorithms; I was confident with the language.
        This was the year I looked back over the HTML code from Dreamweaver and
        began delving into the ins and outs of a web page. I turned back to
        SoloLearn, I did the HTML and CSS course and began practising in
        creating simple pages.
      </p>
      I watched many great Web Dev Youtubers: <br />

      <br />
      <p>
        <br />Learning a lot over the years from these amazing creators I
        created many practice sites. One thing I did to keep my passion going is
        look at amazing websites which use features that I can't now do with my
        current skill set. I'd attempt to recreate the page and learn about how
        it works. I continued expanding knowledge over the year watching many
        videos and continued playing around with CSS properties. My message to
        you: <blockquote> "If you have a passion for something keep at it, keep practising
          and always maintain a thirst for knowledge" because as Francis Bacon
          once said: "Knowledge is power"</blockquote>
